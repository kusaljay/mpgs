## Introduction

* This is a React SPA created using create-react-app.

## How to install and run the project

* Clone from github repository to an empty directory.
* In the directory run 'npm install' to bring in all the dependencies.
* Please refer the email sent to see how to connect to back-end database.
* After setting up the database, run 'npm start' to run the app.
* Use [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) to sign in to the app. Use credentials given.

## Assumptions and points to note

* Assumed there's already a user with valid credentials in the database. Therefore didn't attempt to create users in database by signing them up. 
* Always use the credentials given to sign in.
* Using console.log in componentDidMount() to check the database entries in realtime. 
* Attemped to make the views look as close as possible to mock-ups but didn't attempt to exactly replicate styling in mock-ups as access to MYOB style components, fonts and iconography was not provided. Default bootstrap font Open sans and Ionicons are used.
* Didn't attempt to make the views mobile first as the behaviour in mobile form factors were not provided in mock-ups.

## Key libraries and frameworks used

* Latest stable versions of React, React-DOM, React-router-DOM, Bootstrap, node sass, firebase.

## Tests

* Coming soon...
